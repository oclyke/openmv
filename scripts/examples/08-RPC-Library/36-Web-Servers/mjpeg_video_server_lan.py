# MJPEG Video Server
#
# This example shows off how to do MJPEG video streaming with your OpenMV Cam.
#
# Connect to the IP address/port printed out from ifconfig to view the stream via
# your web browser. Chrome, Firefox and the MJpegViewer App on Android have been tested.
#
# NOTE: After closing the connect you may need to close your browser or navigate back
# and wait a while before reconnecting. Modern web broswers try to keep the connection
# alive and cache state which may a little while to clear out (<30 seconds).

# Turn off the frame buffer connection to the IDE from the OpenMV Cam side.
#
# This needs to be done when manually compressing jpeg images at higher quality
# so that the OpenMV Cam does not try to stream them to the IDE using a fall back
# mechanism if the JPEG image is too large to fit in the IDE JPEG frame buffer on the OpenMV Cam.

# `pathname` is the name of the stream resource the client wants. You can ignore this if it's not
# needed. Otherwise, you can use it to determine what image object to return. By default the path
# name will be "/".

# Track the current FPS.
